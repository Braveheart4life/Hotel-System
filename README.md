# Hotel-System
A hotel business gave the analytics team their database to provide business insights, and to give recommendations about the technicalities of running the database.
Five tables were provided: bookings, requests, food orders, menu and rooms (CSV files).
The first priority was to establish an Entity Relationship Diagram. This was done on Power Bi under the Model view.
After creating the ERD, I imported the tables into SQL server to make more meaning of the tables by joining them were necessary.
